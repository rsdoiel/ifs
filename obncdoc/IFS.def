(*IFS.Mod is based on a program in "Programming in Oberon:
Steps beyond Pascal and Modula-2", by Martin Reisner and 
Niklaus Wirth, published in 1992, by ACM Books, Chapter 7.3, 
Pages 92 through 95. 

The program has been modified to conform to Oberon-7 using the
OBNC compiler, v0.16.1 by Karl Landstrom.
